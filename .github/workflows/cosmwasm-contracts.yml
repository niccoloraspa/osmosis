# Cosmwasm Contracts Workflow
#
# This workflow performs various tasks related to the Cosmwasm contracts.
# It includes steps for optimizing contracts, running tests, and checking lints.
#
# Jobs:
# - contract-optimize: Optimizes the Cosmwasm contracts and uploads optimized artifacts.
# - contract-test: Tests the Cosmwasm contracts and checks for any differences in bytecode.
# - contract-lint: Runs formatting and linting checks on the Cosmwasm contracts.
#
# Triggers:
# - pull_request: Triggered on pull requests to any branch.
#   - branches: Triggered on all branches.
# - push: Triggered on pushes to the main branch and any branch that matches the pattern "v[0-9]**".
# - workflow_dispatch: Manual triggering of the workflow.
